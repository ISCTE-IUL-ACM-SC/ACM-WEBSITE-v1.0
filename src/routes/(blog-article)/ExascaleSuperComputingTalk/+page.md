## December 11, 2017: Talk on Exascale Supercomputing by Gabriel H. Loh

**Date:** December 11, 2017  
**Time:** 2:30 PM  
**Location:** ISCTE-IUL, J.J. Laginha Auditorium  
**Sponsor:** ISTAR Lab, IUL

### Abstract:

The need for ever more powerful supercomputers shows no signs of slowing, but pushing to exaFLOP levels and beyond is becoming increasingly challenging. This talk presented an overview of AMD technologies and a vision for a processor architecture for Exascale systems. Gabriel H. Loh detailed the conceptual Exascale Node Architecture (ENA) and Exascale Heterogeneous Processor (EHP) concepts and discussed remaining research challenges.

### About the Speaker:

Gabriel H. Loh, Fellow Design Engineer at AMD Research, holds a Ph.D. from Yale University and has held prominent academic and industry positions. A Fellow of IEEE and ACM Distinguished Scientist, he is a highly respected researcher in computer architecture and emerging technologies.
